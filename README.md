# racket-001
A small project to learn the fundamentals of Racket.

## What's inside?
* `hello.rkt`, a simple program that takes in a name and calls the built-in "print" function to display the message "Hello, User".
* `less-than.rkt`, an algorithm used for sorting strings by their length.
* `max-value.rkt`, a recursive function that finds the maximum value of a simple list.
* `max-value-deep.rkt`, a recursive function that finds the maximum value of a list and works with nested (aka "deep") lists.
